In Java, a class cannot extend more than one class. 
Therefore following is illegal âˆ’

Example:

public class extends Animal, Mammal{}


However, a class can implement one or more interfaces,
which has helped Java get rid of the impossibility of multiple
inheritances.

The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity.

Consider a case where class B extends class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display().

Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation,
 multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.
